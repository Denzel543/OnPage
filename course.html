                  <p>History of Python
                      Python, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, has evolved significantly over the years. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced programmers.
                      
                      Features of Python
                      Readable and Maintainable: Python's syntax is designed to be clear and easy to understand, allowing developers to write less code and achieve more.
                      Dynamic Typing: Variables in Python do not require an explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable.
                      Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, making debugging easier.
                      Extensive Libraries: Python comes with a rich standard library and many external libraries, supporting a wide range of applications.
                      Python's Philosophy
                      Python follows the principle of "There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it." This philosophy encourages best practices and reduces ambiguity in code writing.

                  <h3>Installing Python</h3>
                  <p>Installing Python is a straightforward process that varies slightly depending on your operating system. 
                    This guide will walk you through the installation steps for Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring you have Python set up and ready for programming.
                    Before installation, it’s crucial to understand the versions available. 
                    The latest stable release can be found on the official Python website. 
                    As of now, Python 3.x is the recommended version, as Python 2 has reached the end of its life.
                    Standard Distribution: Comes directly from the Python website, ideal for general use.
                    Anaconda: A distribution focused on data science and machine learning, which includes many pre-installed packages.
                    Miniconda: A minimal installer for Conda, useful for creating isolated environments.
                    For beginners, the standard distribution from python.org is recommended.
